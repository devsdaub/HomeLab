# Install Tailscale on Proxmox

## 1. Proxmox LXC Configuration
Create a Proxmox LXC with Ubuntu 22.04

Open your Proxmox node and go into the Shell (not your Container Console!). 
Replace the container Id with yours (here it's 106):

```shell
nano /etc/pve/lxc/106.conf
```

Add the following two lines into the file:

```bash
lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 10:200 rwm
lxc.mount.entry: /dev/net/tun dev/net/tun none bind,create=file
```

Close it by pressing Ctrl+X , Ctrl+Y and Press Enter

## 2. Setting up Tailscale on Ubuntu 22.04

Next we can install tailscate on our homelab server: [Link to tailscate documenation](https://tailscale.com/kb/1187/install-ubuntu-2204)

```bash
apt install curl

curl -fsSL https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/ubuntu/jammy.noarmor.gpg | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/tailscale-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null

curl -fsSL https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/ubuntu/jammy.tailscale-keyring.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tailscale.list

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install tailscale
```

## 3. Start and Verify Tailscale
The next part is the most important part! We need to select our routes:

In my example I have Docker installed on 192.168.178.65, so i want to make it accessible:

```bash
sudo tailscale up --advertise-routes=192.168.178.65/32
```
If I want to add more, you can just comma-seperate it. You can also add more routes later
```bash
sudo tailscale up --advertise-routes=192.168.178.65/32,192.168.178.5/32
```
Follow the link provided to authenticate your Proxmox server with your Tailscale account.

Check the status of Tailscale to ensure it is running properly:
```bash
sudo tailscale status
```

On the website, click on "Edit route settings" and approve all.

Now you can test your connection and ping the endpoint from your VPS.
```bash
ping 192.168.178.5
```
